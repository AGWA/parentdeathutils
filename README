parentdeathutils
================

diewithparent - Run a program that is killed when its parent terminates.

onparentdeath - Run a program when onparentdeath's parent terminates.

For more information, consult the respective man pages.

These programs make use of the PR_SET_PDEATHSIG argument to the Linux-specific
prctl() syscall.

See https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/remote_ssh_commands_and_broken_connections
for a compelling use case for diewithparent.
